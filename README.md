# acerC720-script
some scripts for installing OpenSUSE on an Acer C720 Chromebook

* I haven't tested to see if this works yet.

	* Furthermore, I am entirely unsure if this'll work

* A kernel with a version number of 3.17 or greater still needs to be install

* grub still needs to manually configured

	* I'm not smart enough to figure out how to automate it

Everything in here, besides 'c720-opensuse.sh' was **NOT** written by me.
I took them from here, https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/503763-Install-OpenSUSE-13-2-on-a-Acer-chromebook-c720
